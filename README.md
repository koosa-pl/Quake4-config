# Quake4-config

This is a config file for Quake 4 on Steam Deck
Just copy to your Quake 4 -> q4base folder and replace original file
Quake 4 should now run on ultra settings with mostly stable 60fps.
Don't change any graphics options in-game, otherwise your config file will reset to default settings.
